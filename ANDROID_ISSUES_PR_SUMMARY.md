# Pull Request Summary

## Summary
Added minimal Android-specific issue tracking functionality to handle crashes, ANRs, performance issues, and other mobile platform incidents.

## Context
Based on AgilePlace work item "DJ - Android Issues", this implementation provides dedicated endpoints and services for tracking Android-specific problems that require mobile platform expertise. The code follows the existing repository patterns for incident management while adding Android-specific attributes like device info, stack traces, and issue types unique to mobile development (crashes, ANRs, battery drain, memory leaks, etc.).

## Implementation

### Key Files Created:

1. **`src/models/android_issue.py`** (90 lines)
   - `AndroidIssue` model with mobile-specific fields
   - `AndroidIssueType` enum (CRASH, ANR, PERFORMANCE, UI_RENDERING, etc.)
   - `AndroidSeverity` enum (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
   - `DeviceInfo` model for tracking affected devices
   - Request/response models for API operations

2. **`src/services/android_issue_service.py`** (221 lines)
   - `AndroidIssueService` class for business logic
   - Methods: `create_issue()`, `get_issue()`, `list_issues()`, `update_issue()`
   - Filtering by issue type, severity, and resolution status
   - Statistics aggregation and occurrence tracking
   - Full audit logging integration

3. **`tests/test_android_issue_service.py`** (228 lines)
   - Comprehensive test suite with 13 test cases
   - Tests for CRUD operations, filtering, pagination
   - Tests for issue statistics and occurrence tracking
   - Fixtures for common test scenarios

4. **`src/api/endpoints.py`** (Modified - added 110 lines)
   - 5 new REST endpoints under `/api/v1/android/`:
     - `POST /android/issues` - Create new issue
     - `GET /android/issues/{issue_id}` - Get specific issue
     - `GET /android/issues` - List issues with filters
     - `PUT /android/issues/{issue_id}` - Update issue
     - `GET /android/statistics` - Get aggregated statistics

5. **`src/models/__init__.py`** (Modified)
   - Added exports for Android issue models

### Design Decisions:

- **Follows existing patterns**: Uses Pydantic models, async service methods, FastAPI dependency injection
- **Audit integration**: All operations logged via existing `AuditService`
- **In-memory storage**: Uses dictionary storage (like other services), ready for database implementation
- **Comprehensive enums**: Covers common Android issue types and severities
- **Device tracking**: Captures device manufacturer, model, Android version, API level
- **Occurrence counting**: Tracks how many times an issue has been reported

## Test Notes

### How to Test:

1. **Syntax Check** (Already verified):
   ```bash
   python3 -m py_compile src/models/android_issue.py src/services/android_issue_service.py tests/test_android_issue_service.py
   ```

2. **Run Tests** (requires dependencies):
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_android_issue_service.py -v
   ```

3. **Manual API Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Start the server
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   
   # Create an Android issue
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/android/issues \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "title": "App crashes on launch",
       "description": "NPE in MainActivity",
       "issue_type": "crash",
       "severity": "critical",
       "app_version": "2.1.0"
     }'
   
   # List issues
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/android/issues
   
   # Get statistics
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/android/statistics
   ```

4. **Verify Integration**:
   - Check that audit logs are created for each operation
   - Verify filtering by issue_type, severity, and is_resolved
   - Test pagination with limit/offset parameters
   - Confirm device info is properly tracked when provided

### Expected Behavior:
- All CRUD operations should complete successfully
- Issues are automatically assigned IDs starting with "ANDROID-"
- Timestamps are tracked for creation, updates, and resolution
- Statistics endpoint returns aggregated counts by type and severity
- Filtering and pagination work correctly
