## Title
As a user, I want to add items to my shopping cart so that I can purchase multiple items at once

## Description
This PR includes the implementation of a basic shopping cart feature, allowing users to add items to their cart. It includes the following changes:

- Added `ShoppingCart` and `ShoppingCartItem` models in `src/models/shopping_cart.py`.
- Created an API endpoint in `src/api/endpoints.py` for handling adding items to the shopping cart.
- This is a basic implementation focused on setting up the core functionality without additional features like removing items or displaying the cart contents.

Please review the changes and provide feedback. This PR focuses on establishing the foundational code for shopping cart management.
